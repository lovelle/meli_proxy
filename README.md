Meli Proxy - incoming data handler

The idea is to do multiple implementations of the same solution involving different tools and langs.

Reasons:

* For performance, because performance is a top requirement,
 it would be good to do benchmark of different solutions and see what happen.

* For fun?

Implementations (for now just python, sorry):

* To get into python implementation go to `python` branch
