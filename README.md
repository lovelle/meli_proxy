Meli Proxy - incoming data handler

The idea is to do multiple implementations of the same solution involving different tools and langs.

Reasons:

* For performance, because performance is a top requirement,
 it would be good to do benchmark of different solutions and see what happen.

* For fun?

Implementations:

* To get into [python](https://github.com/lovelle/meli_proxy/tree/python) implementation go to `python` branch (git checkout python)
* To get into [c](https://github.com/lovelle/meli_proxy/tree/c) api implementation go to `c` branch (git checkout c)
